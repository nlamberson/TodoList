# Todo List - JavaScript

I am using this repository to learn JavaScript, while creating a functional todo list with an included pomodoro timer. This application is modeled off of a tutorial by [Code Explained on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sUhU_eq3g). I followed this tutorial to get an understanding for the basics of JavaScript, and to make a basic Todo List application. Future plans are included in the [Future Plans](##Future-Plans "Goto future-plans") section below.

## Future Plans
